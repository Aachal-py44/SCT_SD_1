create a program that convers temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

Imports:

tkinter as tk: Imports the tkinter library and assigns it the alias tk for easier use.
from tkinter import ttk: Imports specific widgets from the ttk theme engine for a more polished look.

Conversion Functions:

These functions handle the temperature conversion logic for each combination of scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). They perform the necessary calculations based on the provided formula.
convert_temperature function:

This function takes the temperature value, the scale it's currently in (from_scale), and the desired scale (to_scale) as arguments.
It checks if the from_scale and to_scale are the same. If yes, it returns the original value.
Based on the from_scale, it calls the appropriate conversion function (celsius_to_fahrenheit, etc.) to convert to the intermediate scale (Celsius in most cases).
Finally, it converts the intermediate value to the desired to_scale using another conversion function.
If an invalid scale identifier is provided, it raises a ValueError.
on_convert function:

This function handles the conversion button click event.
It tries to:
Get the entered value from the entry widget and convert it to a float.
Get the selected values from the "From scale" and "To scale" comboboxes.
Call the convert_temperature function to perform the conversion.
Update the "Result" label with the converted value and the target scale.
If there's an error (like invalid input or value), it displays an error message in the result label.
GUI Setup:

The code creates the main application window (root) with the title "Temperature Converter".
It then uses various widgets like labels, entry fields, comboboxes, and a button to create the user interface.
Labels provide instructions for each section.
The entry field allows users to enter the temperature value.
Comboboxes with predefined values ("C", "F", "K") allow users to select the from and to scales for conversion.
The "Convert" button triggers the on_convert function when clicked.
Finally, a label displays the conversion result.
Main Event Loop:

root.mainloop() starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application. This loop keeps the window open and listens for user interactions like button clicks or keyboard input.
